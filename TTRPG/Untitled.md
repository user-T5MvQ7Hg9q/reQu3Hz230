You have just carried him inside the vaults underneath the city. Catacombs of Paris.

It is turning into the plain of fire. Soon the city will be uninhabital. Getting there is a challenge in and of itself. Pools of lava are surrounded everywhere.

The dragon plans on destroying the Dragon Lance. He wants to do it while everyone watches so he will make this a ceremony.
