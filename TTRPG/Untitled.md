The Paladins of Bohamut have kept the lance within the city.

A guardian that now has a Dragon's Claw within his heart. You have carried him towards safety where he is about to die. They will corrupt you into dragon defilers.

You have just carried him inside the vaults underneath the city. Catacombs of Paris.

It is turning into the plain of fire. Soon the city will be uninhabital. Getting there is a challenge in and of itself. Pools of lava are surrounded everywhere.

The dragon plans on destroying the Dragon Lance. He wants to do it while everyone watches so he will make this a ceremony.

Nobels that don't care and are already corrupted themselves. Even without the Dragon's Claw

The palace itself has grown corrupted. (with what?)
Torture Chambers (holds many guardians. They were captured.)
Treasure vault (where the dragon sleeps) -- Here are also many magic items?
The Council
More locations are needed (can you help?)

The king himself has gone mad and cruel. He might be saved?

Wrath Cruelty


Roll sneak not to get ambushed.

A cruel noble that tortures information out of guardians to know where their location in the catacombs are.

The torterer is the King's regent.

The prince is there.
















----

It has been a week when the dragon attacked, and everything changed. Carnage and screaming, and the suffering that came after.

The dragon Verrathrax controlling the city by implanting his teeth and claws inside the hearts of everything he captures. Corrupting them into his Dragon Defiler minions. The city slowly sinking into the elemental plane of fire.

You are the last remaining rebellion within the city. The last Holy People of the Order of Bohamut. Taking refuse inside the catacombs of the city.

In one final desperate act you have tried to vanquish Verrathrax with the Dragon Lance. However, the attack failed, the Dragon Lance and your allies were captured and you have carried your leader, Lady Gabriella, towards the catacombs, a Dragon's Claw stuck inside her heart.

- You must capture the Dragon Lance before Verrathrax will destroy it.
- Dorrick the Dwarf Paladin has been captured and he knows the location. He will be tortured.
- Get the Dragon Lance and destroy Verrathrax. He is vain.
- The King has gone mad but he can be saved, as well as his son. The Dragon will use the prince for his own gains. Prodegy.
Dragon Defilers arrive.
