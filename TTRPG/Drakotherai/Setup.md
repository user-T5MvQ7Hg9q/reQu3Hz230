After the second coming of the mothers of all chromatic dragons to the material planes, and the subsequent war of the dragons between the chromatic and metallic dragons, the world was thrown into chaos. All settlements that weren't enslaved by a chromatic dragon or protected by a metallic dragon were reduced to rubble. The war lasted nearly a century, ending in an eventual stale-mate when the two sisters retreated back into the nine hells, and Bahamut went back to his palace in the seven heavens. The worlds that were the battlegrounds, now seeded with more dragons than ever before, were left to rebuild on their own, with more influence from the dragon than before the war.

Humanoids, somehow, managed to persist in this war.
