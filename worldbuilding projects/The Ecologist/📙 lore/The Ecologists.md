A group of xenoecologists on a far-off planetoid find the dwarf planet they're studying and each of its unique inhabitants suddenly threatened by an unauthorized mining operation. The researchers will explore the valley, encounter organisms and biomes only known to this planetoid, and sabotage the mining machinery deployed in areas with high ecological diversity.
