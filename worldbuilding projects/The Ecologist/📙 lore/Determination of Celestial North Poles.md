*As ratified by the Interstellar Standards and Measures Committee (CINeM)*

## Section 1: General Definition  
Pursuant to CINeM Directive 0047-A, the designated axial North pole of a celestial object is defined as the axial extremity which, when the object is observed to revolve around its primary stellar body in a clockwise direction, appears uppermost to the observer. This standard shall serve as the default frame of reference in all systems wherein orbital motion is regular and axial orientation is stable.

## Section 2: Special Circumstances and Exceptions  

#### 2.1 Retrograde Rotation  
In cases where the celestial object exhibits a retrograde axial rotation (i.e., opposite to the direction of orbital revolution), the default North pole definition shall remain as described in Section 1, and the retrograde nature shall be noted as a rotational anomaly. No adjustment to the pole designation shall be made on this basis alone.

#### 2.2 Axial Tilts Approaching Orthogonality (≥ 85°)  
For bodies exhibiting axial inclinations near or equal to 90 degrees relative to their orbital plane, the North pole shall be defined as follows:
- The axial extremity pointing most closely toward the direction of orbital motion shall be designated as North.
- If this determination yields ambiguity (i.e., near-equidistant vectors), the direction facing the primary stellar body shall be preferred, provided it lies within 45 degrees of either pole.

#### 2.3 Tidal Locking  
For tidally locked bodies—those which maintain a fixed rotational orientation toward their primary—the North pole shall be defined as the axial extremity most closely aligned with the direction of the primary stellar body, unless otherwise specified by scientific analysis or colonial directive (see Section 2.5).

#### 2.4 Multi-Star Systems  
In systems containing multiple stellar objects, orbital motion shall be interpreted with reference to the dominant stellar mass—defined as the star contributing the greatest gravitational influence on the orbit of the subject body. The direction of orbital motion around this dominant star shall serve as the basis for North pole determination under Section 1.

#### 2.5 Indeterminate or Chaotic Cases  
In the event that a celestial body lacks a discernible axial rotation, exhibits chaotic spin behavior, or cannot otherwise satisfy the criteria outlined in Sections 1–2.4, authority is hereby granted to the first recognized colonial administration or scientific mission to establish, register, and submit for approval a locally defined North pole, consistent with prevailing observational norms and to be ratified by CINeM within one planetary year of occupation or discovery.

## Section 3: Documentation and Review  
All pole designations must be documented and submitted to the CINeM Registry of Axial Standards (CRAS) for recordkeeping and interstellar navigational consistency. Reviews and revisions may be initiated in response to new data, challenges, or celestial reclassifications.
