An exoplanetoid with a mean radius of 0.2823 Earths, unable to clear its own orbit. It lies within a relatively stable asteroid belt. Determining permanent moons has so far been unsuccessful, though research is ongoing.

### Atmosphere

The planetoid has a thick, Earthlike atmosphere composed of:

- 63% N₂  
- 23% O₂  
- 5% CO₂  
- 7% Ar, Kr, Xe  
- Trace gases: NO, O₃, CH₄, SO₂  
- ~2% water vapor, depending on conditions

Atmospheric pressure: ~0.85 atm at the surface

Thanks to abundant greenhouse gases and water vapor, liquid water persists in select regions—especially near the equator and geothermally active zones.

### Climate

- Global average temp: 275–280 K (2–7 °C)  
- Local highs: up to 295 K (22 °C)  
- Local lows: down to 250 K (-23 °C)

The planetoid has seasons, driven by axial tilt and mild orbital eccentricity.

### Gravity & Magnetic Field

- Surface gravity: ~33% of Earth’s  
- Despite low gravity, atmospheric retention is sustained by:  
  - Continuous volcanic outgassing  
  - A robust magnetic field, unusually strong for its size  
  - Reinforcement from magnetic structures in the surrounding asteroid belt

### Surface & Oceans

The surface is rocky and uneven, despite the body being in hydrostatic equilibrium. Impact events and tectonic activity shape the landscape.

- Large continents dominate
- Small oceans fill basins and lowlands
- Some oceans are geothermally heated
- Volcanism is frequent and geologically significant

### Polar Ice Caps

- North Pole: large, stable ice cap  
- South Pole: small, seasonally variable cap  
- Asymmetry attributed to:
  - Land/ocean distribution  
  - Geothermal influence  
  - Orbital dynamics

### Planetary Time & Sky

- Day length: ~19 hours  
- Sky color: pale green, with subtle seasonal shifts
