An animal with slow locomotion, in obligate mutualistic endosymbiosis with [[üå± Chrysalga polymorpha|Chrysalga polymorpha]]. The algae live within the transparent outer layer of its skin. Can enter a state of suspended animation in harsh conditions to protect itself and C. Polymorpha.
### Aurecaris
- **Type species:** *A. aureus*
- **Common name:** *Golden Grazer*

This genus lives in the [[üèûÔ∏è Austral tundra|austral tundra]], where it grazes on phototrophs and reproduces during the summer, and enters suspended animation during the winter. This turns the austral tundra vibrant and lively during the polar day. During the winter, much of the algal population is consumed to keep the Grazer alive during its suspended animation. During the summer, newborns and adults who have depleted their algal population to the point of no return dig through the receding snow looking for food, which will inevitably allow them to find algae to absorb into their skin.

| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Activity cycle**    | Active in austral summer; enters suspended animation during long winters                                                                            |
| **Phototroph type**   | Dense population of algae in the outer dermal tissue                                                                                                |
| **Locomotion**        | Slow, gliding or crawling; limited range                                                                                                            |
| **Feeding**           | Scrapes phototroph films, also supplemented by its symbiont's photosynthate                                                                         |
| **Reproduction**      | Synchronized seasonal spawning; juveniles typically receive the algae required to survive from the environment within the first week of their lives |
| **Survival strategy** | Enters tun state with symbiont in cyst form during freezing or dark periods                                                                         |
| **Body shape**        | Broad, flat body with minimal protrusions; shell-like dermal armor                                                                                  |
| **Coloration**        | Bright gold, derived from dense colonies of endosymbiotic algae                                                                                     |

### Vivicaris
- **Type species:** *V. vivicaris*
- **Common name:** *Common Grazer*

This genus lives in the [[üèùÔ∏è Equatorial wetlands|equatorial wetlands]] where it's the primary grazer. It's active year-round but less resilient to change due to lower evolutionary pressure. Nevertheless the fossil record shows that the genus can survive an impact winter without going extinct.

| Trait                 | Description                                                             |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Activity cycle**    | Active year-round due to stable equatorial conditions                   |
| **Phototroph type**   | Thinner distribution of symbionts in skin, optimized for diffused light |
| **Locomotion**        | Slightly more mobile; may burrow during drought                         |
| **Feeding**           | Feeds on submerged phototrophs, detritus, and supplements with symbiont |
| **Reproduction**      | Continuous or seasonal, depending on wet/dry cycles                     |
| **Survival strategy** | Can estivate during extreme drought or cold snaps                       |
