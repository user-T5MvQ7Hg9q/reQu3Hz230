- **Clade:** Astrolithophyta
So far we've discovered many variants of this alga that are all genetically remarkably similar. We've decided to classify them all within the same species.
## C. p. commensalis
- **Habitat:** [[üèûÔ∏è Austral tundra|Austral tundra]]
This variant of the species is common within the outer dermal layer of [[ü¶ê Phyllophoridae|Aurecaris]]. Throughout the light season, this subspecies relies on the Common Grazer to grow and reproduce. It grows during spring and summer, external growth starts to appear as the temperatures reach its peak, especially near the Grazer's creases and folds. This causes the animal to rub against it and allows the algae to release asexual clones of itself onto the ground. When the light dims during autumn, sexual reproduction occurs. As spores sprout and proliferate throughout the last days of light, they eventually set and enter a state of dormancy using cysts that lasts the whole dark winter. C. p. commensalis, like several other subspecies and even other species, has been found to have a high amount of antifreeze proteins in its cysts, allowing long dormancy during frigid periods. During spring, the cysts are consumed by the Common Grazer, and the cysts break down, activating the algae that are then absorbed into the skin of the Grazer, starting the cycle anew.
