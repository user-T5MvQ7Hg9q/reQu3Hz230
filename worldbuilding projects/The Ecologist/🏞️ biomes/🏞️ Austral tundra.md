In the seasonally frigid south is the Austral tundra. A large, open biome reminiscent of the tundras of Earth. During the dark, sunless winter, this land is frozen and lifeless. During the warmer and lighter summer, however, this landscape turns a bright golden hue from blooming algae and symbiotic grazers.
