Hundreds to thousands of years ago there was a mighty society. They managed to perform incredible feats and live in a world without conflict. Before the collapse, wars were few and far between, and incredible leaps in magic and science were made, elevating all people living in it into what now might be considered godhood. The most mundane of tasks, such as transcribing, cleaning, serving, mining and even some forms of crafting were automated by machines. The need for trade greatly diminished, and merchantry was rare. Their language is a dead one. Not a soul speaks it anymore, apart from the few words we've managed to learn to write and string together to serve our magical needs and desires.
