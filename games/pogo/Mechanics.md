You can jump, double jump and forward, up and down slash.

Spikes don't deal damage, as damage is not a thing, but they do incapacitate you until you land on solid ground again. (or possibly after 5 seconds)

when down slashing, momentum continues unless something is successfully hit.

The current sprites are 32x32 for the normal grounded and jumping sprite and 32x48 for the down slashing sprite.
